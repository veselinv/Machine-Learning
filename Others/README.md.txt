# Others

The 'Others' section contains various notebooks produced by me for various machine learning projects. The data needed to run much of the code is not provided, as some of that is proprietary.

## Roadworks Classification

The 'Roadworks Classifier' notebook was used as the basis for a small project on classifying whether an image (mostly car dashcam) contains roadworks or not. Plenty of markdown and documentation; no data.

## Neural Style Transfer

The neural style transfer notebook builds images that merge the content of one image with the style of another, based on the popular method by Leon Gatys et al. Minimal documentation.

## Regression Ensembles

The regression ensemble builder is a notebook that builds pipelines of regression model ensembles, including grid search for the shallow algos, and a rudimentary random search for the neural networks. Minimal documentation.
