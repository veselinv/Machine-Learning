# Tutorials

The 'Tutorials' section contains various tutorial-like notebooks produced by me for showcasing some machine learning principals. All code runs in Google Colab, and there's no need to manually download anything.

## AutoEncoder

'AutoEncoder' is a notebook based on a separate tutorial, showcasing the basic principals of machine vision.

## Word2Vec

'Word2Vec' works alongside the AutoEncoder notebook to reinforce the notions of quantifying semantics, and explores the use cases of working with that by way of math with word encodings (i.e., King - Man + Woman = Queen).
